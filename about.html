            Adell's chocolate is a family business. We care about connecting you to 
            your family and want you to feel connected to ours. Chocolate is something
            that has been been connecting our family for years because,
            while creating delicious products was certainly on Adell's mind when she started
            making these chocolates, there was a bigger purpose in mind.
          </p>

            Construction of a temple had just commenced in the small town of Saint George, Utah,
            and there were not enough people or resources there for the temple to
            be built. Adell saw a need and immediately started cooking up a way to help.
            With faith in her heart and a desire to give she set out making and selling
            chocolates. The money she made was donated to the construction of this 
            sacred building and the whole family pitched in to help. Other members
            of the community and surrounding area pitched in to help in whatever way they 
            could and the Saint George temple was built. Right along with it was built
            a family tradition that spans generations. Each year our family comes together
            to make and eat chocolate together and give to those in need. Because of this, 
            chocolate holds a special place in our hearts, and our hope is that Adell's 
            Chocolates can bring a little piece of that joy and love into your home.
